An End to End AI system 
This system is being developed to provide end to end AI solutions with feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization and tuning.
Algorithms buit

To do algorithms

1. Random Forest
2. Support Vector Machines
3. Decision Tree
4. kNN
5. Logistic Regression
6. Stochastic Gradient Decent
7. Perceptron 
8. Naive Bayes
9. Linear SVC
10. Deep Neural Networks (upto 100 layers searching for different parameters, 1D)
11. Convolutional Neural Networks
12. Sequence Models 
13. Reinforcement Learning
14. Bayesian Methods

This goals of this system are to become reach the level of AutoML.
